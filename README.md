- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kingerthanu
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding a larger expanse of coding languages and helping better some tedious experiences
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, Java, NodeJS, and others. (I currently am very well rounded in Java and Python)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my current projects, and am always welcome to tweaks and tips to my code.
